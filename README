Dogma (which stands for “DialOgue Game MAnager”) is a normative module
to manage conventional interaction based on the notion of dialogue
games. Dogma is a tool to help to design the conventional dialogic
behavior of an agent that interacts with humans (or other agents). As
such, it is conceived as a part of a dialogue manager currently limited
to two-party dialogue.

   * Scala 2.11+ (http://www.scala-lang.org/)
   * SBT 0.13+ (http://www.scala-sbt.org/)

- Steps:
   1) Checkout the code:
      git clone https://github.com/GuillaumeDD/dogma.git
   2) Into the project, you can:
      * Compile the project:
        $ sbt compile
      * Test the project:
        $ sbt test
      * Run the project:

      * Generate the documentation:
        $ sbt doc

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Main elements of Dogma are:
- README: this file
- COPYING: license of Dogma
- Dogma: Dogma source file
- PredicateCalculus: a simple library to deal with predicate calculus
- SimpleSemantics:  a library implementing a simple semantics
- UML: UML diagrams of the code source of Dogma

DOCUMENTATION
-------------
Documentation can be generated by executing:
   $ sbt doc

UML diagrams of the code are available in directory 'UML' at the root of
the project. They have been made with UMLet (https://code.google.com/p/umlet/).

DEVELOPMENT
-----------
The easiest way is probably to use Scala Eclipse (http://scala-ide.org/).
You can generate an eclipse project from the source by running:
   $ sbt eclipse
Next, you can import the project into Scala Eclipse via:
